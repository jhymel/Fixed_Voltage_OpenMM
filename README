 
   This is software for running general Fixed-Voltage MD and Monte Carlo in OpenMM.  The code has been generalized to work for flat electrodes with additional conductor objects attached to the electrode,
   for example, carbon nanotubes and Buckyballs.

   This code contains defines an 'MM' class which contains all of the data structures and methods needed for MD/MC and the Poisson solver.
   This is intended to be combined with separate 'QM' class based on Psi4 to run Fixed-Voltage QM/MM simulations

   Currently, we have two examples:

   1)  Example_Gold_water_MC:
         this is a Monte Carlo equilibration for the gold electrode/water systems that Sue is working on.

   2)  Example_Electrodes_nanotube_BMIM_BF4_ACNT_FV:
         this is a Fixed-Voltage MD simulation of BMIM/BF4/ACNT electrolyte between two electrodes,
         where the Cathode has an attached carbon nanotube held at fixed voltage
